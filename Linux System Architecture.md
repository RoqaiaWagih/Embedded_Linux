### What does Kernel Mean?

A **kernel** is the core component of an operating system. It manages the system's resources and allows other programs to run and use these resources. It acts as a bridge between applications and the hardware of a computer.

### What does Operating System Mean?

An **operating system (OS)** is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. It is essential for the overall functioning of a computer, handling tasks like file management, memory management, process management, and device management.

### Is Linux a Kernel OR Operating System?

**Linux** is technically a kernel, but it is often referred to as an operating system when combined with GNU software and other components. The term "Linux" is commonly used to describe distributions (distros) that bundle the Linux kernel with various software and tools, making a complete operating system.

### What is an Architecture Layer Diagram?

An **Architecture Layer Diagram** visually represents the different layers within a system, illustrating how components interact with each other. It often includes layers like hardware, kernel, system libraries, and application software.

### What is User Space?

**User space** refers to the memory area where user-mode applications run. These applications interact with the kernel via system calls, but they do not have direct access to the hardware.

### What is Kernel Space?

**Kernel space** is the memory area where the kernel executes and provides its services. It has full access to the hardware and is isolated from user space to protect the system's stability and security.

### Describe Main Layers for Linux Kernel

1. **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)**
   - **Purpose:** Abstracts hardware specifics from the kernel.
   - **Interaction:** Provides a uniform interface to interact with the hardware, allowing the kernel to manage different hardware without needing to understand its specifics.

2. **Kernel (Core)**
   - **Purpose:** Manages system resources, process scheduling, memory management, and system calls.
   - **Interaction:** Interfaces with the hardware through HAL and provides an API for higher-level operations.

3. **Device Drivers**
   - **Purpose:** Allow the kernel to communicate with hardware devices.
   - **Interaction:** Interact with the HAL to send and receive data from hardware devices.

4. **System Call Interface (SCI)**
   - **Purpose:** Provides an interface for user applications to communicate with the kernel.
   - **Interaction:** Acts as a mediator between user space and kernel space, translating user requests into kernel actions.

5. **Filesystems**
   - **Purpose:** Manage data storage, organization, and retrieval on storage devices.
   - **Interaction:** Works closely with device drivers to read and write data to physical storage.

### Identify the Purpose for Each Layer

- **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):** Simplifies hardware access for the kernel.
- **Kernel (Core):** Core management of system resources and processes.
- **Device Drivers:** Enable communication between the kernel and hardware devices.
- **System Call Interface (SCI):** Facilitates user-kernel interaction.
- **Filesystems:** Manage storage devices and data access.

### Identify How Each Layer Interacts with the Lower One

- **HAL:** Interacts directly with the physical hardware, providing a standard interface for the kernel.
- **Kernel:** Uses the HAL to manage hardware resources and supports higher-level functions.
- **Device Drivers:** Communicate with hardware through the HAL and provide functionality to the kernel.
- **SCI:** Bridges the user applications and kernel functions.
- **Filesystems:** Rely on device drivers to access physical storage.

### What is Glibc Library?

The **GNU C Library (glibc)** is the C library used in many Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It provides the system calls and basic functions such as open, malloc, printf, etc. that applications need to interact with the kernel and perform standard operations.

### What Does Command Mean?

A **command** in computing is an instruction given by a user to a computer program to perform a specific task. Commands are typically entered via a command-line interface (CLI).

### Describe Command in Terms of the Following:

#### Name
The name of the command, which is used to invoke it (e.g., `ls`, `grep`, `cat`).

#### Location
The file system path where the command's executable is located (e.g., `/bin/ls`, `/usr/bin/grep`).

#### Version
The version of the command or software, which can typically be checked using a specific flag (e.g., `ls --version`).

#### Input
The data or parameters passed to the command to process (e.g., `ls /home/user`).

#### Output
The data produced by the command after execution (e.g., a list of files and directories in the specified path).

## Input
The input for a command can be arguments or options passed in the command line. For example:
```sh
ls /home/user
```
Here, `/home/user` is the input path provided to the `ls` command.

## Output
The output is what the command returns after processing the input. For example, the `ls` command will list the files and directories in the specified path.

## Example
```sh
# Example usage of the ls command
ls /home/user
```

This will output the contents of the `/home/user` directory.
## In-session Tasks
#### Slide Subtitle
- 	Please write the following command:
- 	g++ â€”version.
- 	What is the output?
- 	Add a new command to your system to print the process userlD.
- 	Ex: > userid
-  > output: UserlD = 11000
