## System Call Analysis

### Introduction
System calls are the interface between user programs and the operating system. Analyzing these calls provides insights into how commands interact with the OS.

### Commands Analyzed
 
- `ps`: Displays information about running processes.  
- `cd`: Changes the current directory.
- `ls`: Lists directory contents.

### Tracing Method
We used `strace` to trace system calls:
- **ps:** `strace -T -o ps_time.txt ps`

- **cd:** `strace -T -o cd_time.txt bash -c "cd /desired/path"`

- **ls:** `strace -T -o ls_time.txt ls`

### System Calls Summary
- **ps:** Involves system calls like `open`, `read`, `write`, `stat`, and `mmap`.
- **cd:** Utilizes `chdir`, `stat`, and `openat`.
- **ls:** Uses `open`, `readdir`, `close`, and `stat`.

### Performance Analysis
- The most time-consuming calls were `open` and `stat`, reflecting the need to access file metadata.
- `ps` made the most system calls, with `mmap` contributing significantly to its execution time.
